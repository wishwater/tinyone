<h1>Five Nights at Freddy's One</h1>

<p>Five Nights at Freddy's is a point-and-click survival mystery video game created by Scott Cawthon. The game centers on a fictional pizza restaurant called "Freddy Fazbear's Pizza", where the player must act as a night security guard, defending themselves from the malfunctioning animatronic characters by tracking their movement through the facility using security cameras.
Five Nights at Freddy's was first released on August 8, 2014, on Desura. On August 20, 2014, Five Nights at Freddy's was also released via Steam after it was approved by the service's crowdsourcing platform Greenlight. Mobile ports of the game have been released for Android and iOS.</p>

<h1>Five Nights at Freddy's Two</h1>

<p>Five Nights at Freddy's 2 is an indie point-and-click survival horror video game created by Scott Cawthon. It is the second game in the Five Nights at Freddy's series. The game was released on Steam on November 10, 2014, earlier than its two planned dates of sometime in 2015 and December 25, 2014, respectively, with the latter due to issues with releasing the demo. The mobile port for Android was released on November 13, 2014.
The player plays as Jeremy Fitzgerald, as opposed to Mike Schmidt from the first game. Despite being a prequel, it features six brand new antagonists as well as heavily damaged versions of the original five antagonists from the first game. Unlike the first game, there are no doors to close; instead, the player must put on a Freddy Fazbear mask to avoid being killed by most of the animatronics.</p>
